# üìå DevOps Assignment 3: System Monitoring, User Management, and Backup Configuration

## üìñ Overview
This repository contains solutions for a DevOps assignment that involves setting up system monitoring, user workspace management, and automated backup configurations for web servers. The implemented solutions include the use of monitoring tools (htop or nmon), user account configuration with security measures, and automated backups for Apache and Nginx web servers, scheduled via cron jobs. All tasks are properly documented with clear instructions and output verification.

## ‚úÖ Solved Tasks

### üöÄ Task 1: System Monitoring Setup
Objective: Configure a monitoring system to ensure the development environment‚Äôs health, performance, and capacity planning.

#### Steps:
1. Installed and configured **htop** or **nmon** to monitor CPU, memory, and process usage.
2. Set up disk usage monitoring using **df** and **du** to track storage availability.
3. Copy the Content of the Scripts in Q1 folder to your linux instance
4. Make them executable with chmod +x "your_script_name.sh"command
5. Schedule them to run on cronjob with passwordless sudo execution provision

PS: Some commands inside script require sudo permissions, so ensure you have passwordless execution for the same for it to run successfully on cronjob

### üöÄ Task 2: User Management and Access Control
Objective: Set up user accounts and configure secure access controls for the new developers.

#### Steps:
1. Created user accounts for **Sarah** and **Mike** with secure passwords.
2. Set up isolated directories: 
   - Sarah: `/home/Sarah/workspace`
   - Mike: `/home/mike/workspace`
3. Enforced appropriate permissions to ensure only respective users can access their directories.
4. Implemented a password policy to enforce expiration and complexity (passwords expire every 30 days).
